# prochot_disable
An automated shell script to disable BD_PROCHOT on some Dell laptops.

## What is BD_PROCHOT?
BD_PROCHOT is a CPU register that lowers the CPU clock speed when the laptop gets hot, which can cause throttling and performance issues on Dell laptops.
This script disables it so you can keep on gaming.

It also can lower the clock speed even when the laptop isnt hot, causing Games like Minecraft with BSL Shaders to run very poorly.

## Tested on:
Dell Inspiron 15 7000 Gaming
